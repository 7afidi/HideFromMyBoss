Born from the ancient art of looking busy when your boss has turned "checking on you" into an Olympic sport. 🏃‍♂️

## What's This Sorcery? 🤔
A Python script that automatically hides your second monitor windows when your mouse moves to the primary screen. Because your boss's "just checking in" visits happen more often than your coffee breaks.

## Features ✨
- Automagically hides monitor 2 windows when mouse moves to monitor 1
- Windows reappear when you return to monitor 2
- Zero clicks required - move mouse, poof! 
- Runs silently in background like that one coworker who never attends meetings
- Perfect for "research purposes" 😉

## Origin Story 📖
Created during the great "My Boss Is Behind Me Every Minute" crisis of 2024. Necessity is the mother of invention, and constant supervision is the father of sneaky Python scripts.

## Quick Start 🚀
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
Now you can "focus on your tasks" faster than your boss can say "what are you working on?"

## Use Cases 🎯
- Job hunting while "updating documentation" 
- "System testing" (AKA gaming sessions)
- Freelancing during "code reviews"
- Side project coding in "debug mode"
- Other interviews during "doctor appointments" 😉

## Pro Tips 💡
- Keep work stuff on monitor 1
- Put "professional development materials" on monitor 2
- Practice smooth mouse movements (you'll need them)
- Perfect for those "I was just reading the documentation" moments

## License 📜
MIT - Because sharing is caring, especially among the constantly supervised.
